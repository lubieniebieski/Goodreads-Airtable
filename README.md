This is a fork of https://github.com/Evilbits/Goodreads-Airtable. I've decided to give it a bit more polish and change a few features suited for my needs.

# Goodreads-Airtable

Fetch your "read" and "to-read" shelves from Goodreads and sync with an Airtable.

## Setup

1. Setup Airtable with needed columns
    - TBD - the structure is still in progress
2. Copy `.env.sample` to a new file called `.env` and put in your data

## Usage

You can use `docker-compose`:

    docker-compose up
